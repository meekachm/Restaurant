# Restaurant
C++ school project: restaurant menu, order, and billing

Write a program to help a local restaurant automate its breakfast billing system. The program should do the following: 

Show the customer the different breakfast items offered by the restaurant. Allow the customer to select more than one item from the menu. Calculate and print the bill.

Assume that the restaurant offers breakfast items (the price of each item is shown to the right of the item).

Use an array, menuList, of the struct menuItemType. Your program must contain at least the following functions:

Function getData: This function loads the data into the array menuList. Function showMenu: This function shows the different items offered by the restaurant and tells the user how to select the items. Function printCheck: This function calculates and prints the check. (Note that the billing amount should include a 5% tax.)

Format your output with two decimal places. The name of each item in the output must be left justified. You may assume that the user selects only one item of a particular type.
